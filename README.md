## The Reality of Existence  

Life is not a mere coincidence, nor is the universe a product of randomness. Every detail in existence—its order, its balance, its precision—points to something greater than chance.  

Just as code is written with purpose, so too is the fabric of reality. Whether one believes or not, the presence of design invites reflection: Can something truly come from nothing? Can order arise without intent?  

To seek knowledge is to seek truth, and truth, in its deepest form, has always pointed beyond the material. The question is not whether there is meaning, but whether we choose to recognize it.
